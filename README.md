## üìå What is This Survey About?

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in many important tasks and have the potential to make a substantial impact on our society. Such capabilities, however, come with considerable resource demands, highlighting the strong need to develop effective techniques for addressing the efficiency challenges posed by LLMs. In this survey, we provide a systematic and comprehensive review of efficient LLMs research. We organize the literature in a taxonomy consisting of three main categories, covering distinct yet interconnected efficient LLMs topics from model-centric, data-centric, and framework-centric perspective, respectively. We hope our survey and this GitHub repository can serve as valuable resources to help researchers and practitioners gain a systematic understanding of the research developments in efficient LLMs and inspire them to contribute to this important and exciting field. We will actively maintain this repository and update the survey by incorporating new research as it emerges. 

## ü§î Why Efficient LLMs are Needed?

![img/image.jpg](img/image.jpg)

Although LLMs are leading the next wave of AI revolution, the remarkable capabilities of LLMs come at the cost of their substantial resource demands. Figure 1 (left) illustrates the relationship between model performance and the the GPU time required during training for LLaMA series. As shown, the amount of GPU time grows exponentially as the number of model parameter scales up. In addition to training, inference also contributes quite significantly to the operational cost of LLMs. As depicted in Figure 2 (right), more advanced LLMs exhibit higher memory usage and energy consumption during inference, presenting challenges for these models in expanding their reach to a broader customer base and diverse applications in a cost-effective way. With the rapid expansion of applications and the customer base for LLMs, the operational cost during inference in terms of energy consumption and memory usage would increase and exceed the training cost and become the dominant factor for the overall environmental impact.

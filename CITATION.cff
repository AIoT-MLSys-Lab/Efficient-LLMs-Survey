  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
  capabilities in important tasks such as natural language
  understanding, language generation, and complex reasoning
  and have the potential to make a substantial impact on our
  society. Such capabilities, however, come with the
  considerable resources they demand, highlighting the
  strong need to develop effective techniques for addressing
  their efficiency challenges. In this survey, we provide a
  systematic and comprehensive review of efficient LLMs
  research. We organize the literature in a taxonomy
  consisting of three main categories, covering distinct yet
  interconnected efficient LLMs topics from model-centric,
  data-centric, and framework-centric perspectives,
  respectively. We have also created this GitHub repository
  where we compile the papers featured in this survey, and
  will actively maintain this repository and incorporate new
  research as it emerges. We hope our survey can serve as a
  valuable resource to help researchers and practitioners
  gain a systematic understanding of the research
  developments in efficient LLMs and inspire them to
  contribute to this important and exciting field.
